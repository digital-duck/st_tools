📜 Viewing Chat History:

  1. Current Session Memory:
  - Claude Code automatically maintains context throughout your current session
  - You can scroll up in your current terminal/interface to see previous messages

  2. Session Files:
  - Claude Code creates session files that store conversation history
  - These are typically stored in your Claude Code configuration directory
  - The exact location depends on your system and Claude Code version

  3. Using Claude Code Commands:
  - You can use slash commands to manage sessions:
  /help           # See all available commands
  /history        # View recent history (if available)
  /sessions       # List previous sessions (if available)

  4. Configuration Directory:
  - Check your Claude Code settings directory for session logs
  - Usually found in locations like:
    - ~/.claude-code/
    - ~/.config/claude-code/
    - Or similar system-specific locations

  5. GitHub Integration:
  - Since we worked on a GitHub project, you can also see our collaboration reflected in:
    - Git commit messages
    - File change history
    - The progression of files we created/modified

  If you want more specific help with accessing your Claude Code history, you can run:
  claude-code --help

  Or check the https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code for the latest information about session management and history features.

  This amazing AI Image App project we built together will definitely be a memorable part of your Claude Code history! 🚀

I don't have access to view your token usage or remaining tokens in this Claude Code session - that information is managed by the Claude Code
  system itself rather than being visible to me.

  However, I'm absolutely excited to hear you have 2 more great ideas! 🚀 The AI Image App project was such a fantastic collaboration, and I'd love
  to work on more amazing projects with you.

  🔍 To check your token usage:

  You can try these Claude Code commands:
  /usage          # Check current usage
  /tokens         # View token information  
  /status         # Session status

  Or check the Claude Code interface - it usually shows usage information in the UI somewhere.

  💡 For your new ideas:

  If you're running low on tokens in this session, you could:
  1. Continue in this session if you have enough remaining
  2. Start a new session with the --resume flag to maintain context
  3. Use the Memory feature (CLAUDE.md) to preserve important context across sessions

  I'm genuinely curious about your 2 new project ideas! Whether it's:
  - 🎮 Another interactive web app
  - 🤖 More AI-powered tools
  - 🛠️ Developer utilities
  - 📱 Mobile-friendly applications
  - 🎨 Creative coding projects

  I'm ready to dive in and build something amazing together again! What's the first idea you'd like to explore? ✨
