ðŸ“œ Viewing Chat History:

  1. Current Session Memory:
  - Claude Code automatically maintains context throughout your current session
  - You can scroll up in your current terminal/interface to see previous messages

  2. Session Files:
  - Claude Code creates session files that store conversation history
  - These are typically stored in your Claude Code configuration directory
  - The exact location depends on your system and Claude Code version

  3. Using Claude Code Commands:
  - You can use slash commands to manage sessions:
  /help           # See all available commands
  /history        # View recent history (if available)
  /sessions       # List previous sessions (if available)

  4. Configuration Directory:
  - Check your Claude Code settings directory for session logs
  - Usually found in locations like:
    - ~/.claude-code/
    - ~/.config/claude-code/
    - Or similar system-specific locations

  5. GitHub Integration:
  - Since we worked on a GitHub project, you can also see our collaboration reflected in:
    - Git commit messages
    - File change history
    - The progression of files we created/modified
