## Abstract

This research paper explores the application of machine learning techniques in automated document analysis. We examine various approaches including supervised learning, unsupervised clustering, and deep learning models for text classification, information extraction, and semantic understanding.

## 1. Introduction

The exponential growth of digital documents has created an urgent need for automated processing solutions. Traditional rule-based systems are insufficient for handling the complexity and variety of modern document formats.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Organizations face significant challenges in:
- Processing large volumes of unstructured text
- Extracting relevant information efficiently

- Multiple formats: PDF, DOC, TXT
- Balanced class distribution
- Cross-validation partitioning

### 3.2 Feature Extraction

We employed several techniques:
- **TF-IDF**: Term frequency-inverse document frequency
- **Word2Vec**: Dense vector representations
- **BERT**: Contextual embeddings
- **N-grams**: Character and word level features

1. **Baseline Models**
   - Naive Bayes
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors
